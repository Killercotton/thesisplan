\chapter{Combining hardware and software for stereo vision implementation}
\label{ch:five}
\section{Abstract}
\rro{Performance comparison}
Build a stereo vision module that makes use of both the FPGA and the Gumstix, that means an implementation that combines hardware 
and software in an appropriate way. Compare performance with other implementations that only use hardware(FPGA) or software.
